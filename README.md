* Using a word cloud

What am I allowed to do with a word cloud on WordItOut? 

Word clouds are licensed under a Creative Commons Licence, specifically an Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivative Works Creative Commons Licence (4.0). That’s quite hard to say out loud.

This means that if it’s just for your own, personal use, then you can do lots of things, such as embedding the word cloud on your own website or blog. If you do this, we only ask that you give credit to WordItOut and include a link to our website or the word cloud. For the full details, see the Creative Commons Licence.

* Printing

How do I print a word cloud?

Your web browser (the software you’re using now to access the internet) can print the word clouds, but will probably remove some of the colours. We recommend you to download the word cloud as an image and then print it.

* Saving

Can I save the word cloud as an image?

Yes you can! First you need to save the word cloud on WordItOut (no sign-up, only requires your email address -and no spam too!). Then click on the ‘Download’ button just below the word cloud to save your own copy to your computer. However, if you want to put a word cloud on your own website, you don’t need to do this, you can embed the word cloud, which will automatically resize as well. See the following section.

* Embedding

How does embedding work?

To embed a word cloud, you need to copy the html code provided and paste it into your own (non-commercial) website. The word cloud will grow or shrink to fit the space you’ve put it in. Don’t forget that you need to mention WordItOut and put a link back to our website (we’ve provided some code as an example, you can customise if you wish).

How can I change the size of my embedded word cloud?
In the code, you will see the following: <div style='width:auto;height:auto;'>. You can simply change the auto (for either the height or width) to a number of pixels or a percentage e.g. 400px or 50%
