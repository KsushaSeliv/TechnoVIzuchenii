Using a word cloud

* What am I allowed to do with a word cloud on WordItOut? *

Word clouds are licensed under a Creative Commons Licence, specifically an Attribution-Non-Commercial-NoDerivative Works Creative Commons Licence (4.0). That’s quite hard to say out loud.

This means that if it’s just for your own, personal use, then you can do lots of things, such as embedding the word cloud on your own website or blog. If you do this, we only ask that you give credit to WordItOut and include a link to our website or the word cloud. For the full details, see the Creative Commons Licence.
